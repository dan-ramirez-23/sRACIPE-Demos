# Additional examples from sRACIPE


This repository contains Rmarkdown walkthroughs demonstrating optional features in sRACIPE, including perturbation-based signaling and different gene expression noise models.

Time benchmarking of multistable and oscillatory circuits using the microbenchmark package is found in the benchmarking folder. Comparisons of models of circuits using either transcription factor or protein degradation interactions are in the RegulationTypeComp folder.
